Hand Written Digit Recognizer

The classifier takes an 8*8 pixel greyscale image as input and classifies it into one of the 10 digits.
Support Vector Machine Classifier with gamma = 0.001 was used.
Around 25% of the Data Set was used to test the model. The resultant accuracy was found to be greater than 90%.

-The source code of the project is the python file "DigitClassifier.py"
-A test image(The number '2' in grayscale 8x8 pixels) is available in the file "two3.jpg"
