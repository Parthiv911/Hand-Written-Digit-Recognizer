Hand Written Digit Recognizer

The classifier takes an 8*8 pixel greyscale image as input and classifies it into one of the 10 digits.
Support Vector Machine Classifier in sklearn with kernal = "rbf" and parameters gamma = 0.001 and C=1 was found to give the best results and hence was used.

The Data Set used to train the model contained 3823 training and 1797 testing images and was taken from the UCI ML Repository.

The resultant accuracy score was found to be greater than 98.2%.

The Confusion Matrix is as follows

Confusion matrix:

     0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
0  176    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0

(By definition a confusion matrix is such that Cij is equal to the number of observations known to be in group i and predicted to be in group j)
